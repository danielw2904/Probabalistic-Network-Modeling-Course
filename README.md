# Probabalistic-Network-Modeling-

# Lab ideas
- Day 1: Getting started with R, downloading and visualizing data, converting edge list to adjacency matrix, igraph, 
and exploring project ideas, Nimble tutorial and logistic regression
- Day 2: Nimble basic sbm 
- Day 3: Extended SBM, degree corrected or mixed membership
- Day 4: Basic latent factor model vs logistic regression

# Schedule
- Interactive stuff earlier on day 1
- EDA session: small world session, look for hubs
- Switch visualization first in slides

  - change number of communities and compare WAIC
- DCSBM
  - Accuracy measures
  - MCMC diagnostics
  - Application
- Latent space model
  - Add logL
  - Accuracy measures
  - MCMC diagnostics
  - Application
  - Questions: add log likelihood to check mixing
- Dynamic latent space model
  - Run longer, save results
  - MCMC diagnostics and accuracy
  
- Misc
  - Add images and examples to David's slides
  - Add preview of lab stuff
  - Ask TA about submission tech
  - Ask Noella about menu
  - Put together a couple of sample data sets
