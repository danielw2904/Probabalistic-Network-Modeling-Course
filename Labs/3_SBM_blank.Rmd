# Simulate from a general stochastic block model 

First we simulate from a general stochastic block model with no
constraints on between versus within block connectivity.

Recall the SBM: stochastic equivalence means that edge probability
between any two nodes is fully determined by group membership
(summarized in the $n \times K$ matrix $Z$) of the respective nodes,
group-wise edge probabilities are described by the $K \times K$
symmetric matrix $\Theta$.
$$Y_{pq} \mid Z \sim \text{Bernoulli}(Z_{p.}^T \Theta Z_{q.})$$

We assume independent Dirichlet-multinomial priors on group membership and 
independent beta priors on block connection probabilities:

$$\pi(Z \mid \lambda ) = \prod_{p=1}^n Z_{p.}^T \lambda \\
    \lambda \sim \text{Dirichlet}(\alpha 1_K) \\
    \alpha \sim \text{Gamma}(a,b) \\
    \theta_{ij} \sim \text{Beta}(a,b) \text{ for } i,j = 1, \cdots, K.$$ 

Note that the prior on $\alpha$ above is optional, a reasonable choice as discussed in lecture is $1/K$
where $K$ is an upper bound on the number of groups.


We simulate from this model in the code below. 
```{r}
set.seed(100) # 10 gives more clear blocks by chance, 100 less clear

# Setup data structure
n.nodes <- 50
n.groups <- 3

# Set hyperparameters
a <- 2
b <- 2

# Simulate group membership
lambda <- rdirch(n=1, alpha = rep(1/n.groups, n.groups)) 
z <- sample(1:n.groups, size = n.nodes, prob = lambda, replace = TRUE)
z.mat <- matrix(0, nrow = n.nodes, ncol = n.groups)

for(i in 1:n.nodes){
  z.mat[i,z[i]] <- 1
}

# Simulate connection probabilities
theta <- matrix(NA, nrow = n.groups, ncol = n.groups) # matrix of group-edge probabilities
theta[upper.tri(theta, diag = TRUE)] <- rbeta(n = n.groups*(n.groups + 1)/2, a, b)
theta[lower.tri(theta, diag = TRUE)] <- t(theta)[lower.tri(theta, diag = TRUE)]

# Compute connection probs for each pair of nodes
pi.mat <- z.mat %*% theta %*% t(z.mat) # ignore diagonal here: no self-edges (loops)
diag(pi.mat) <- NA

# Simulate data
Y <- matrix(NA, nrow = n.nodes, ncol = n.nodes)
Y[upper.tri(Y)] <- rbinom(n.nodes*(n.nodes - 1)/2, 1, pi.mat[upper.tri(pi.mat)])
Y[lower.tri(Y)] <- t(Y)[lower.tri(Y)]
rownames(Y) <- colnames(Y) <- paste0("Node ", 1:n.nodes)

# Might need to add diag to Y to avoid errors
diag(Y) <- 0

# Plot the data
sel <- order(z)
z_sorted <- z[sel]
Y_sorted <- Y[sel, sel]

pheatmap(Y_sorted, cluster_rows = F, cluster_cols = F,
         color=colorRampPalette(brewer.pal(9,"Greys")[c(1,8)])(30), 
         main = "Observed Adjacency Matrix", 
         fontsize = 8, show_rownames = T, show_colnames = T, 
         legend = F)

```


# Fitting a stochastic block model with NIMBLE

Now we define and fit the model with Nimble. 


```{r, message = FALSE}
# Define model with BUGS code
sbmCode <- nimbleCode({
  
  # lambda - latent group assignment probabilties (vector of length K)
  lambda[1:K] ~ ddirch(alpha[]) 
  
  # Z - latent group indicator (binary vector of length K, summing to 1)
  for(i in 1:N){
    Z[i] ~ dcat(prob = lambda[])
  }
    # theta - symmetric matrix of within and between group edge probabilities
  for (i in 1:K){
    theta[i,i] ~ dbeta(shape1 = a, shape2 = b) # Within block connections
    for (j in 1:(i-1)){ 
      theta[i,j] ~ dbeta(shape1 = a, shape2 = b) # Between block connections 
      theta[j,i] <- theta[i,j] # symmetric matrix
    }
  }

  # Pi - node to node edge probabilities (based on group membership)
  for (i in 2:N){
    for (j in 1:(i-1)){ # Self-edges not allowed
      Pi[i,j] <- myCalculation(theta[,], Z[i], Z[j]) # Workaround because nimble does not allow indexing by latent variables
      Y[i,j] ~ dbin(size = 1, prob = Pi[i,j])
    }
  }

})

## User-defined functions: written in NIMBLE
myCalculation <- nimbleFunction(
  run = function(grid = double(2), index1 = double(0), index2 = double(0)) {  ## index could be int() but model variables are represented as double anyway
    return(grid[index1, index2])
    returnType(double(0))
  })

# Define the constants
sbmConsts <- list(N = n.nodes, K= n.groups,
                  a = a, b = b,
                  alpha =  rep(1/n.groups, n.groups))

# Define the data
sbmData <- list(Y = Y)

```

***

### Exercise 
Supply reasonable initial values using basic summaries of the data and data structure. 
After completing model setup, comment on conjugacy detection, and run the MCMC. 

***


```{r, eval = FALSE}
theta.init <- matrix(0.1, n.groups, n.groups)
diag(theta.init) <- 0.8
pi.init <- 
# Set initialization parameters
sbmInits <- list(lambda = rep(1/n.groups, n.groups), # block assignment probs
                 theta = theta.init, # edge probs, better init
                 Pi = matrix(0.5, n.nodes, n.nodes), # edge probs
                 Z = sample(1:n.groups, size = n.nodes, replace = TRUE)) # group indicators

# Create NIMBLE model
sbm <- nimbleModel(code = sbmCode, name = "sbm", constants = sbmConsts, data = sbmData, 
                   dimensions = list(lambda = c(n.groups), theta = c(n.groups, n.groups), 
                                     Pi = c(n.nodes, n.nodes)), 
                   inits = sbmInits)
# Check conjugacy
configureMCMC(sbm, print = TRUE)

# Easiest way to run: 
niter <- 50000
nchains <- 2
nburn <- 1000
mcmc.out <- nimbleMCMC(code = sbmCode, constants = sbmConsts,
                       data = sbmData, inits = sbmInits,
                       nchains = nchains, niter = niter,
                       nburnin = nburn,
                       summary = TRUE, WAIC = TRUE,
                       monitors = c('lambda', 'theta', 'Z'))
```

Now we evaluate the results. How does mixing look? 

```{r, echo = FALSE}

## MCMC diagnostics
sbm.samples <- mcmc.out$samples

# Block connection probabilities
mcmc_trace(sbm.samples, regex_pars = c("theta")) 

# Block assignment probabilities
mcmc_trace(sbm.samples, regex_pars = c("lambda")) 

```

The trace plots above demonstate (at least) two problems: poor mixing and label switching, 
and so provide an important reminder about identifiability in the SBM. 
Often SBMs are used for community detection, and in those cases, inference on $\theta, \lambda$
is not of particular interest, the clustering assignment is. While sorting $\lambda$ within each 
chain can often result in consistent block assignment probabilities, post-processing 
of the clustering labels is a more complex task, which we'll explore below. 

As a quick note on the diagnostics above, keep these in mind that the data was generated
from a general SBM with relatively weak differences in connectivity patterns from block
to block. 


### Post processing: create a posterior cluster assignment

As we see from the output above, the model does not produce a single
partitioning of the nodes, but rather a posterior distribution over the
space of $K$ -partitions. The decision-theoretic approach of Wade and
Ghahramani (2018) provides a means of summarizing the posterior. One
method under this approach utilizes the variation of information (VI) as
a loss function. Intuitively, VI compares the information in two
partitions to the information common between them; for the technical
details, see Meila (2007).

We obtain a point estimate for the clustering $\hat{z}$ as the partition
with the minimum posterior averaged VI distance from the other
partitions:
$$\hat{z} = \text{arg min}_{z'} E_z[VI(z,z')|Y].$$


The package `mcclust.ext` packages provides several optimization methods
for the minimization above.


```{r}
# Extract mcmc  samples
samples <- do.call(rbind, mcmc.out$samples)
z.samples <- samples[, grepl("Z", colnames(samples))]

# Compute posterior similarity matrix
z.psm <- comp.psm(z.samples) 
plotpsm(z.psm) # note data points are reordered by hierarchical clustering here

# Find a representative partition of posterior by minimizing VI
z.vi <- minVI(z.psm, method = "greedy") 
summary(z.vi) # if you use method = "all", this compares them all 
z.cl.post <- z.vi$cl
```


Now that we have identified a representative clustering, we can plot it. 

***

### Exercise
Plot the posterior clustering vs the true clustering using the method of your choice. 
How does the model perform on visual inspection?

***

***

### Exercise

Rerun the above code for a few different seeds. How does model performance
vary? Does it do better on more assortative data?

***

# Simulate from an assortative stochastic block model 

While the general stochastic block model is very flexible and does not
enforce high within block connectivity, the *assortative* pattern in
which nodes within a block are more likely to be connected than nodes in
different blocks is often observed and is a common goal of community
detection. 

***

### Exercise

Simulate from an assortative SBM and plot the resulting data. To get started, you
might want to explore the parameters of the Beta distribution, and recall that if
$x$ has a B$(\alpha, \beta)$ distribution, then $E[X] = \frac{\alpha}{\alpha + \beta}$. 


***

```{r}

# Define range
p = seq(0, 1, length=100)

# Create plot of Beta distribution with various shape parameters
plot(p, dbeta(p, 2, 10), type='l', ylab = 'Density')
lines(p, dbeta(p, 2, 2), col='red') 
lines(p, dbeta(p, 5, 2), col='blue')

legend(x = .7, y = 4, legend = c('Beta(2, 10)','Beta(2, 2)','Beta(5,2)'),
       lty=c(1,1,1), col=c('black', 'red', 'blue'))



```


***

### Exercise
Modify the NIMBLE created to fit the general SBM to fit an assortative SBM.

### Exercise

from part 1. Comment on any differences in MCMC diagnostics and
accuracy.

## Refitting with weakly informative prior

# Trade application


***

### Exsercise

Fit a stochastic block model with the priors of your choice to the trade data and
evaluate performance. 

***

***

### Exercise

Recall the basic network logistic regression model: 

$$\text{logit} ((p(y_{ij}= 1)) = \text{logit} (\pi_{ij}) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{ij},$$ where our edge covariate is an indicator that the two countries are in the same region, $x_{ij} = 1(R_i = R_j)$.

How could you modify the SBM model to compare the SBM coefficients to the logistic regression 
coefficients?

How does the SBM perform relative to the two network logistic regressions? Interpret
this, addressing: (i) the importance of regional vs latent clustering, 
(ii) the degree of node heterogeneity.

# ASSIGNMENT
Continue working with your selected data set and analyze it using one of the stochastic
block models above. If you are unsure about hyperparameter selection, use some prior
predictive checks to evaluate your choices. Additionally, you might consider varying 
your priors, particularly the degree of assortativeness and compare the resultant models using some of the accuracy 
measures presented previously. 

Is there any natural grouping to compare the posterior clustering assignment with? 
If so, interpret any noteworthy discrepancies.

If your network is large and convergence is poor, there are several options for
improving performance: experiment with alternative NIMBLE
samplers, use a package such as `sbm` (uses variational EM), write your own Gibbs 
sampler (slightly ambitious given the time constraint), 
or subset the data (just make sure you provide justification for your 
subsetting scheme).
